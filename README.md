As credit card usage increases, so does the prevalence of fraudulent transactions. Detecting these frauds is a key application of anomaly detection, as it aims to identify suspicious or unauthorized transactions (outliers). This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud by analyzing transaction patterns, identifying anomalies, and evaluating model performance through various metrics and visualizations.
